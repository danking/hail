        <p>
          Hail is an elastic system and language, exposed as a Python library, for the
          interactive analysis of genetics-datasets of arbitrary size. The Hail system and
          language are each comprised of a local and distributed component. The
          distributed language expresses relational and linear algebraic operations on
          one- and two-dimensional external memory arrays.  The distributed system
          schedules directed acylic graphs of jobs on an elastic cluster. The distributed
          system includes an elastic service which stores, partitions, and orders
          intermediate data. The local language describes operations on a rich set of
          internal-memory data-types. The local system implements the aforementioned
          operations on Hail objects that are represented using a custom memory
          format.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Hail distributed system schedules two types of jobs on an elastic,
          multi-tenant cluster of virtual machines. The first type of job, called a Query
          job, is a Hail local expression. As described below, a Hail distributed
          expression is implemented as a directed acyclic graph of Query jobs, each job
          operating on a partition of the data. The second type of job, called a Batch
          job, is a docker image. Tasks may depend on an arbitrary number of other jobs
          within their "batch", which is our term for a collection of interdependent
          jobs.
